        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="para">Instead of ordering pizza for your next party, wow your guests with these crispy, caramelized, pizza-flavored cheese chips!</p>
        <p class="para">Since everybody agrees that the best parts of a pizza are those spots where the cheese sort of drips off and caramelizes onto the pan, getting crispy, crusty, and incredibly delicious, I took those cheesy drips and made chips!</p>
        <p class="para">Serve as-is or top with a bit of baby arugula and fold in half to eat like tacos.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
            <li>30 slices pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 13x18-inch, half-sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Grate provolone and mozzarella cheeses with the larger side of a box grater into a large bowl. Use the smaller side and grate in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss with your hands to combine.</li>
            <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cheese mixture into 12 circular piles on the prepared baking sheet, making sure you're getting all three cheeses in each scoop. Top each circle with about ¾ teaspoon pizza sauce, then place a slice of pepperoni on top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until melted and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove parchment paper and chips to a wire rack to cool. Line the baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to bake remaining 18 chips.</li>
            <li>Let chips cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the parchment paper and serve.</li>
        </ol>
